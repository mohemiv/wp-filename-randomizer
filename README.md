Filename Randomizer for WordPress
========
Filename Randomizer adds randomization to file names when uploading files into [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org/).

This is a security plugin designed to prevent unauthorized access to materials that are not published on your website yet or are not intended to be published. 

Features
---------------------------
The plugin adds "xxxxxxxx-" prefix for each uploaded file. The original file name will be kept, only the prefix adds randomization. The prefix may contain only [a-f0-9] characters to increase the readability of the final file name.

In case image scaling is used, all scaled images would contain the same prefix. This plugin protects materials only from stealing before publication but doesn't prevent downloading full-resolution images for the convenience of all website visitors.
